# discordbots

In Discordbots you will find my personal coded discordbots which I use for private matters. The is yet only one but more to come. 

Explanation of the bots:
CodeLogger:
  Codeloggers purpose is to safe a unique code of a discorduser with the ID of the user to an excel-document with a command. Not everyone can safe the code, there is a whitelist which can be edited. You are able 
  to output the codes via a discordcommand. CodeLogger automatically checks if the code is vald after certain parameters. 
  
  What has to be done on the bot:
    Editing via discordchat of the codes
    Removing of codes in excel
